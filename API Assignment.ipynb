    "Ans: Advantages of API : 1)Efficiency- When you have content that is automaticallypublished and made available on different\n",
    "     channels simultaneously, APIs allow for more efficient data distribution.\n",
    "     2)Adaptability- Onw of the greatest benefits of APIs is the ability it has to adapt to changes through data migration \n",
    "     and flexibility of services.\n",
    "     Disadvantages of API: 1) Creating API is a very time- consuming process.\n",
    "     2) Maintainance cost is very high.\n",
    "     3) Imprecise boundary delineation.\n",
    "     4) A fixed scale is necessary."
